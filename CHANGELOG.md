# Changelog

All notable changes to the agent images are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each entry is condensed from that version's
`.github/releases/<tag>.md`, which the publish job turns into the GitHub release.

## [0.2.0] - unreleased

### Added
- Image contract 2: proxy mode. `AGENT_PROXY_URL` (+ `AGENT_CA_FILE`) routes every
  client — `git`, `gh`, the agent CLI, `mise`, `npm`, Node's `fetch` — through a
  runner-owned MITM proxy instead of the domain allowlist: the firewall drops to a
  single ACCEPT for the proxy address and rejects Docker's embedded DNS resolver
  outright, `agent-entrypoint` trusts the proxy's CA and exports the client env vars
  every provisioning step and the final command need, and `lib/prompt.sh` gains
  `agent_require_proxy_or_secret`, which accepts the runner's credential sentinel only
  when the firewall's own proxy-mode marker proves a real lockdown is in effect.
  `allow-domains.d/*` and `allow-ranges.d/*` are inert in this mode.
- `smoke.sh` case 9: a host-side MITM fake proxy exercises the full sentinel-to-header
  path for both the Anthropic API-key and OAuth-token sentinels, `gh`, `git`, `mise` and
  Node's `fetch`, alongside the proxy-mode firewall's DNS and IP-literal canaries.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added
- `ghcr.io/influpert/agent:base`: Debian trixie (digest-pinned), git + git-lfs, gh, jq,
  tini, mise, a uid-1000 `agent` user, the default-DROP egress firewall with a composable
  hostname allowlist and shipped GitHub ranges, secret staging as agent-owned files, two
  workspace provisioning modes, and a `setpriv` privilege drop to an empty capability set.
- `ghcr.io/influpert/agent:claude`: Claude Code 2.1.236 and the `agent-claude` CMD that runs
  one headless session with the prompt on stdin and the credential only in its process.
- `smoke.sh`, the fake-driven test suite, `ci.yml` (check, build + smoke, publish on `v*`
  tags) and `bin/release`.
